hdStore aims to provide cross-browser persistent storage capabilities and simple data manipulation

TODO:

1.  Implement get & set for hdStore.count and hdStore.item.
2.  Throw meaningful Error objects.
3.  Implement save method for < IE8.
4.  Document all public functions (jsDoc).

Discussion topics:

How do we want to implement the different browser save functions? It's a factory pattern but the different implementations to choose from are huge!
Should we provide a way to clone hdStore? We could use the hdStore.filter method.
If hdStore.item(key, newItem) is called with a key that doesn't exist, a new item is created. Do we want this side-effect? #3
Chrome 2.0 does something fucked up with arrays, like auto-sort... Thus failing test #13.2 #13.3 and #14.2
Opera 10 has changed behavior for try..catch statements from Opera 9, thus failing test #5.3
