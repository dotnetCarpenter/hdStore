hdStore aims to provide cross-browser persistent storage capabilities and simple data manipulation.
Different persistent storage capabilities are implemented through a plug-in system.

Supports: IE5.0 to 8.0, FF3.5, Safari4

Discussion topics:

Should we provide a way to clone hdStore? We could use the hdStore.filter method.
Chrome 2.0 does something fucked up with arrays, like auto-sort... Thus failing test #13.2 #13.3 and #14.2
Opera 10 (but not from Opera 10.10) has changed behavior for try..catch statements from Opera 9, thus failing test #5.3
